composer require "laravel/homestead=~5.1"

config\app.php

The web.php and api.php are mapped in app\Providers\RouteServiceProvider.php

php artisan make:model Buyer
php artisan make:model Seller
php artisan make:model Category -m
php artisan make:model Product -m 
php artisan make:model Transaction -m 
php artisan make:controller User/UserController -r


The character set under the database.php is upgraded from utf8 to utf8mb4 in order to support some characters sets and emoticons in the database 
hence upgrading it in Schema::defaultStringLength(191) because mysql only supports 767 
'charset' => 'utf8mb4',

This calculation can be done by multiplying 255*4 = 1040,
767/4 = 191 for utf8mb4
